* Education

- MSc (Civilingenjör) Computer Science at Chalmers University of Technology :: /2008 -- 2016/

     I study the Master's Program /Computer Science - algorithms, languages and logic/. Relevant courses: /functional programming/, /advanced functional programming/, /parallel functional programming/, /Algorithms/, /Advanced Algorithms/, /Discrete Optimization/, /Types for Programs and Proofs/, /AI/ and /Concurrent Programming/. In these courses I have used /Haskell/, /Python/, /Erlang/, /C/, /Agda/ and /Java/.

* Work Experience

- Master Thesis :: /2015 October -- current/
     
     The thesis explores different representations of string data in /Erlang/, in the context of Ericsson's SGSN-MME. The SGSN-MME is a massive concurrent Erlang system, running hundred of thousands of Erlang processes. I have examined Erlang and its virtual machine, /BEAM/, in detail. During the thesis I have mainly used Erlang, but also /C/, making changes to the BEAM, that is written in C. I have visited the /OTP/ team, the main developers of Erlang, in Stockholm and received feedback on the ideas presented in the thesis.

- Software Developer at Ericsson :: /2010 -- 2015/

     I worked as a software developer at Ericsson in parallel with my studies at Chalmers. At Ericsson I had the freedom to learn new languages, libraries and tools, which provided me with a lot of coding experience, that I would not have gained by only studying at Chalmers. I mainly developed in /Scala/, /Erlang/, /Python/, /JavaScript/ and /C/, learning libraries and tools such as /Git/, /Pandas/, /D3.js/, /Flask/, /Node.js/ and /JFreeChart/.

- Assistant for a disabled student at Chalmers :: /2011 -- 2015/

     Employed by Chalmers to help a disabled student to get to different classrooms between lectures. It taught me to be flexible and improved my social skills.

- Assistant at bookstore Antikvariat PAN :: /2007 -- 2014/
     
     I sold books and movie-posters at a bookstore called Antikvariat PAN while studying at Chalmers and working at Ericsson. The job mainly involved interacting with customers, guiding them through book shelves and organize the inventory. I was often alone in the store, which taught me responsibility and to be customer-oriented.

- Assistant repairman at Data Assistent :: /2007 -- 2010/
     
     I occasionally helped repairing computers and configure Linux.

- Telemarketing for Hörselskadades Riksförbund :: /2006 -- 2007/

     Collected donations over telephone. The process taught me to be patient.
  
* Programming Experience

- Pit4 prototype :: /2015 January -- 2015 February/ 

     A prototype web-application for log visualization at Ericsson. The motivation behind this application was to solve the problem of rendering interactive graphs with a big amount of data-points in a browser. The application automatically adjusts the level-of-detail without loss of significant data-point nor performance. The backend is based on the /Python/ libraries /Flask/ and /Pandas/, and the frontend on /D3.js/.

- Project managing tool :: /2014 May -- 2014 September/ 

     A web-application for planning and managing projects at Ericsson. It is currently widely used by managers and is currently being maintained by a team at Ericsson. The backend is implemented using /Node.js/ and the frontend in /D3.js/.

- Issue-ticket monitor :: /2013 May -- 2014 December/ 
     
     A web-application for Ericsson that visualizes the flow of issue-tickets through the different teams and shows their productivity. The backend is written in /node.js/ that communicated with the issue-report system through /Perl/, and generated data for the frontend written in /d3.js/.
     
- TTCN logger for Titan :: /2012 January -- 2012 September/ 

     I helped develop a logger for the Titan system at Ericsson. Titan is a  toolset based on the TTCN-3 scripting language, that is used for functional testing of communication systems. The logger was written in /C++/.
  
- Pit3 :: /2011 January -- 2015 May/
     
     I was the main developer of Pit3, a log visualization tool widely used at Ericsson. The application is written in /Scala/ and uses /JFreeChart/ as its graph library. It is able to concurrently parse a variety of in-house log-formats used by Ericsson, and render data in real-time. The program has some unique features for interactively exploring and working with a big set of time-series data. It has effective solutions to handle the memory consumption of the /JVM/, while at the same time using high-level functional data-structures and rich types in Scala.

- Erlang to C :: /2010 June -- 2010 September/ 
     
     I ported an /Erlang/ library to /C/ at Ericsson. The goal was to increase libraries performance, but also to explore the ability to reload /NIFs/ (Erlang functions implemented in C) in an Erlang system during run-time.
     
- Examined ETS in Erlang :: /2010 March  -- 2011 January/ 

     I explored the memory consumption of data stored in /ETS/-tables at Ericsson. The work resulted in a proposal for improvement to /OTP/, the main developers of /Erlang/. OTP implemented this change, and it is currently a part of the current OTP version.

* Hobby Projects

- portenv :: /2016 January -- 2016 February/

     Portable environment based on Arch Linux. Portenv enables the usage of the package manager /Pacman/ on any Linux host, by running a minimal Arch Linux distribution and a fake-root user in the home directory. 

     https://github.com/andrejlamov/portenv

- isolol :: /2015 December -- 2016 January/

     Fun with isometric perspective and /canvas/ in /JavaScript/.

- Worklog :: /2015 May -- 2015 September/ 

     A prototype web-application for reporting time and assigning tasks. It is designed to be modular and is a real-time multi-user system. It uses /web-sockets/ for real-time communication, and has a REST API and a publish-subscribe system, both reachable through web-sockets and GET/POST-requests.
     
- you can call me cal :: /2015 March - 2015 April/

     A prototype of a calendar visualization written in /d3.js/. The events in the calendar are packed to take up as little space as possible.

     http://andrejlamov.github.io/you_can_call_me_cal/

     A proxy /node.js/ server that is able to start other server applications. Node-in-a-node can start a specific version of the application which is passed to the proxy via url. Note that Node-in-a-node can start itself at a given version, hence the name.

- mylxpanel :: /2014 May -- 2014 June/
